# Atlis
Atlis is my very first major project as a beginner. It started with wanting to turn off the security lights at home for my parents. They turn off the lights in the morning but come back to meet the house in darkness at night, before they can find their way to the nearest switch. I later saw the possibility of its use elsewhere. Details coming up.
